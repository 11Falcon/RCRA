# Image Classification and RDF Graph Generation with ConceptNet and YOLO

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building an Image Classification pipeline combined with RDF Graph Generation using **ConceptNet** and **YOLO**. The goal is to create a system that classifies images, links the results to semantic data, and visualizes the outcomes in an interactive way.

## Features

- **Image Classification with YOLO**:  
  Classified input images using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and labelling.
  
- **Semantic Enrichment with ConceptNet**:  
  Queried the **ConceptNet** knowledge graph via **SPARQL** to retrieve semantic relationships between detected objects in the images.
  
- **RDF Graph Construction**:  
  Constructed enriched **RDF graphs**, combining image metadata (such as labels and detected objects) with external knowledge from ConceptNet.
  
- **HTML Visualization**:  
  Delivered an **HTML-based visualization** of the RDF graphs, including both **graphical** and **tabular representations** of the data.
  
- **Knowledge-Driven Insights**:  
  Integrated image classification and semantic enrichment to enable knowledge-driven insights and provide meaningful visualizations.
